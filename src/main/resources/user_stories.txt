I want to have my workout planned for me based on my previous workouts
so that I know what to do in the gym without thinking too much

As a user
I want to create/update/delete exercises

As a user
I want to see a list of primary exercises
so that I can update my 5RM

As a user

so that I can update my last session data

As a user
I want to be able to update the current workout
so that if one exercise is not available (or I don't want to do it), I can choose another (or just a random other)

As a user
I want to be able to update my workout weight/sets/reps information
so that it can be taken into account for the next time

As a user
I want to be able to choose the weight/sets/reps of a given exercise of it is the 1st time I'm doing it

As a user
I want to be able to perform different kind of exerice where the sets/resps pattern is not standard
so that it is not always the same (ex drop set, super set...)

As a user
I want to be able to modify the pattern of my workouts


A given workout session should follow a pattern, based on the GSCL-P method
Patterns should rotate every 4 days

Patterns:
D1
	T1: Bench Press
	T2: Squat
	T2: Back
	T3: Triceps
	T3: Face Pull

D2
	T1: Deadlift
	T2: OHP
	T2: Legs
	T3: Biceps
	T3: Shoulders

D3
	T1: Squat
	T2: Bench Press
	T2: Back
	T3: Triceps
	T3: Face Pull

D4
	T1: OHP
	T2: Deadlift
	T2: Pecs
	T3: Biceps
	T3: Legs

There are two categories of exercices
	Primary: T1 which alternates with T2
	Secondary: T2 and T3

For T1 and T2, there are 3 stages of sets/reps. When one stage cannot be fully completed, next time this exercise is done, go to next stage.	

T1
	5x3+
	6x2+
	10x1+
T2
	3x10
	3x8
	3x6
T3
	3x15+ or high volume	

When last stage is failed:
	T1: Test 5RM -> 85%
	T2: Take last weight successful on Stage 1 -> add 5-6 kg

For secondary exercises, one should be chosen from a list of exercises whithin the given category
